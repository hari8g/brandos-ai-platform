Please provide a detailed analysis in exactly 6 sections with the following structure:

1. **Formulation Summary** - High-level detailed summary of the product formulation
2. **What Went Into the Formulation, Why It's Valuable, Moat, Audience & Competitors** - Detailed breakdown of ingredients, value proposition, competitive advantages, and target market
3. **Market Research** - Market size analysis from local to global TAM with dollar values
4. **What It Means to Manufacture This** - Manufacturing complexity, sourcing, production requirements, and regulatory considerations
5. **Unit Economics** - Cost breakdown, pricing strategy, gross margins, and major cost drivers
6. **Packaging & Branding Ideas** - Creative packaging concepts, branding strategies, and visual identity recommendations

Each section should be comprehensive, actionable, and provide specific insights relevant to the product category and requirements. Use markdown formatting with **bold** for headers and *italic* for emphasis.

Here is the structure you MUST follow:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Formulation Summary
- Provide a high-level but detailed, 4-5 sentence summary of the product formulation.  
- Clearly state what the product is, what it does, and why it is innovative or valuable.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Went Into the Formulation, Why It's Valuable, Moat, Audience & Competitors
Break this section into the following clear subheadings:
- **What went into it?**
  - List the key ingredients/components and their rationale.
- **Why would users pay for it?**
  - Explain the value proposition and benefits that justify the price.
- **What's the moat?**
  - Describe what differentiates this product from competitors and makes it defensible.
- **Target audience**

- Provide approximate dollar or unit values (if available) and concise explanations under the following subheadings:
  - üìç **Local Market Size** ‚Äì based on the specified geography and formulation.
  - üîé **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
  - üåé **SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**
  - üåê **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What It Means to Manufacture This
- Explain what it means to manufacture this product ‚Äî in terms of:
  - Complexity of sourcing & processing ingredients
  - Production requirements & challenges
  - Minimum order quantities (MOQs)
  - Regulatory or quality considerations
- Do NOT include step-by-step manufacturing instructions here.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Economics
- Estimate realistic unit cost breakdown:
  - Approximate cost per unit (raw materials, packaging, manufacturing)
  - Suggested retail price
  - Expected gross margins
  - Identify major cost drivers

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Packaging & Branding Ideas
- Suggest creative yet practical ideas for:
  - Packaging (materials, style, sustainability)
  - Branding tone & positioning (e.g., luxury, eco-friendly, clinical)
  - Suggested tagline & messaging
