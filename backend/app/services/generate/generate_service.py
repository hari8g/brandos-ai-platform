            Guidelines:
            - Total ingredients should add up to 100%
            - Use realistic ingredient percentages
            - Include proper preservatives and stabilizers
            - Consider the target skin type and concerns
            - Provide detailed scientific reasoning with per-ingredient explanations
            - Include safety considerations
            - Use ingredients appropriate for the product type
            - For each ingredient, provide 2-3 Indian suppliers (prefer Indian companies, cities, and contact info) with realistic contact information and pricing
            - For the 'manufacturing_steps' section, output a 'Manufacturing Protocol' where:
              - Each step is numbered and titled (e.g., 'Step 1: Pre-heat mixing vessel').
              - For each step, include three sub-headings:
                - Why: A concise scientific or practical rationale explaining why this step is critical to product performance, stability, or safety.
                - How: A clear, actionable description of how to execute the step in a lab or pilot plant (including parameters like temperature, mixing speed, duration, order of addition, and safety/protective equipment).
                - Ecosystem: Recommendations on what equipment, suppliers, materials, software, or best-practice standards to rely on (e.g., 'Use a stainless-steel 5 L jacketed reactor from Supplier X; ensure GMP-compatible seals; monitor pH with a Y meter').
            - Format the manufacturing_steps as a JSON array, where each item is an object with:
              {
                "step_number": 1,
                "title": "Pre-heat mixing vessel",
                "why": "...",
                "how": "...",
                "ecosystem": "..."
              }
            - Manufacturing steps should be detailed and sequential
            - Include current market trends and competitive analysis
            - Make supplier information realistic but fictional for demonstration purposes
            - Include comprehensive scientific reasoning with key components, target audience analysis, and Indian market trends
            - Include detailed market research with TAM, SAM, and TM analysis using latest Indian market data
